## System Summary

The TRIDENT-Net system has been successfully implemented as a modular multimodal fusion framework with the following key capabilities:

**Core Features:**
- Multimodal processing for visible/EO, radar, and thermal/IR sensors
- Multiple fusion strategies (SVM, cross-attention, fuzzy rules)
- Guard mechanisms for consistency checking and spoofing detection
- Explainable AI with attention maps and event tokens
- Real-time inference via REST API
- Comprehensive training and evaluation pipeline

**System Outputs:**
- `p_outcome ∈ [0,1]`: Probability of outcome
- `binary_outcome ∈ {0,1}`: Binary prediction
- `explanation`: Detailed reasoning with attention maps

**Key Implementation Highlights:**
- Type-safe design with comprehensive type hints
- Modular architecture allowing independent component training
- Configuration-driven workflow via tasks.yml
- Synthetic data generation for testing without real data
- Production-ready server for streaming inference
- Extensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, F1, Brier, ECE, time-to-confidence)

The system is ready for training, evaluation, and deployment according to the original specifications.
