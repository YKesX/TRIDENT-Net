# Action Log

## Initial Setup
- Created project structure with pyproject.toml and requirements.txt
- Defined Python 3.10+ requirements with PyTorch ecosystem
- Set up build system with setuptools and proper metadata

## Project Structure Creation
- Setting up modular architecture with separate packages for:
  - common/ (shared types, utilities, metrics)
  - data/ (dataset handling and synthetic generation)
  - i_models/ (EO/Visible processing modules)
  - r_models/ (Radar processing modules)  
  - t_models/ (IR/Thermal processing modules)
  - fusion_guard/ (Fusion and spoofing protection)
  - runtime/ (Training, evaluation, serving infrastructure)

## Core Design Principles
- Type hints throughout for better code clarity
- Docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Small, testable, modular components
- Generic domain language (avoiding weapon terminology)
- Consistent interfaces across all modules
